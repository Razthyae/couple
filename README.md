# How to play
Throw the dice, earn Lust Points (LP), and embark on a journey of pleasure together! In Couple's Game, each round intensifies, transitioning from lighthearted foreplay to... well, you know what ;)

Navigate the game board featuring 3 types of tiles:

- Lust Point Tile: Collect LP for exciting experiences.
- Movement Tile: Progress your journey.
- Action Tile: Engage in romantic tasks for your partner or have something special yourself!

Remember the golden rule of Couple's Game: Maximize pleasure for both players!
